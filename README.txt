This is my own tutorial code written to help learn and refresh any C++ subjects that I may need to look up. 
All of this is my own code which is commented for me to easily look back on whenever I need to refresh my memory.
This gets added to frequently and once its ready, I may organise the code so it can link with my c++ tutorial blog as an extra download.
